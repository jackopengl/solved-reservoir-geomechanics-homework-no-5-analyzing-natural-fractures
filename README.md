<br>
In this homework assignment, you will analyze natural fracture data interpreted from an FMI image log in a vertical well from the Barnett shale. This image log has been processed using the software GMI Imager, in which fractures were picked as abrupt contrasts in the electrical resistivity image of the borehole wall. The interpreted fracture data from the image log can be downloaded by clicking the right tab on the top of this page. An applet from <u>http://app.visiblegeology.com/stereonetApp.html</u> may be helpful.

From the discussion on mini-frac or extended leak-off tests, choose the correct statement,




Fracture Breakdown Pressure (FBP) is the best estimate of the least principal stress (S3) magnitude, even if Instantaneous Shut In Pressure (ISIP) measurement is available.




Correctly interpreted Instantaneous Shut In Pressure (ISIP) is a reasonable estimate of the least principal stress (S3) magnitude.







Why is the leak-off pressure a reasonable approximation of the magnitude of the least principal stress?




The slight decrease in the rate of wellbore pressurization is caused by a decrease in the system volume as a result of the onset of hydraulic fracturing.




The pressure-volume curve has reached its summit where the pressure is high enough to propagate a hydraulic fracture.




The noticeable change in the rate of wellbore pressurization is caused by propagation of a hydraulic fracture, which increases the system volume.
